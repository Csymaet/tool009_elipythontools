## 001a-Batch Convert PNG to JPG Format

This is a Python-based program for batch converting image formats. It can convert all PNG images in the specified folder to JPG format and save them to the specified output directory.

### Features

* Supports batch format conversion of all images in the specified folder.
* Allows you to set the format of the converted images.
* The output directory can be customized. If not specified, it defaults to the parent directory of the input folder.

### Dependencies

Before running this program, please make sure you have installed Python 3 and the following dependencies:

`pillow`

* You can install the dependencies using the following command:
`pip install pillow`

* If you are using Arch Linux as your Linux distribution, you can use the following command to install:
`pacman -S python-pillow`

### Usage

Use the following command to run the program from the command line:

* Process a single image: `python 001-image_png2jpg.py /path/from/file /path/to/file`
* Process all images in a folder: `python 001a-image_png2jpg_batch.py /path/from/folder /path/to/folder`

⚠️ Note: `001a-image_png2jpg_batch.py` depends on a Python script named `001-image_png2jpg.py` to perform the actual image format conversion operation. Make sure they are in the same folder.

## 002a-Batch Image Compression Program

This is a Python-based program for batch compressing images. It can automatically compress all image files in the specified folder and save them to the specified output directory.

### Features

- Supports batch compression of all images in the specified folder.
- Allows you to set the maximum size and image quality parameters after compression.
- The output directory can be customized. If not specified, it defaults to the parent directory of the input folder.

### Dependencies

Before running this program, please make sure you have installed Python 3 and the following dependencies:

`pillow`

* You can install the dependencies using the following command:
`pip install pillow`

* If you are using Arch Linux as your Linux distribution, use the following command to install:
`pacman -S python-pillow`

### Usage

Use the following command to run the program from the command line:

* Process a single image: `python 002-image_compress.py -i /path/from/file -o /path/to/file -s 1024 -q 80`
* Process all images in a folder: `python 002a-image_compress_batch.py /path/from/folder /path/to/folder -s 1024 -q 80`

Where:

- The `-s` or `--size` parameter is used to set the maximum size after compression (defaults to 1024).
- The `-q` or `--quality` parameter is used to set the image quality (defaults to 30).

If the `-s` and `-q` parameters are not specified, the program will use the default values for compression.

⚠️ Note: `002a-image_compress_batch.py` depends on a Python script named `002-image_compress.py` to perform the actual image compression operation. Make sure they are in the same folder.

⚠️ Note: PNG images do not support compressing image quality, only reducing image size. If you want to achieve a smaller storage size for PNG images, you can convert them to JPG format first and then perform the compression.
